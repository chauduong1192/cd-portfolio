## Headers

To create a header, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.

```
Header 1
========
Header 2
--------
```

or

```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
```

## New paragraph

Leave a blank line between lines of text.<br/>

## New Line / Line Break

To force a line break,

- Put two spaces and a newline (return) at the end of the line.
- Add \ at the end of line.
- You can also use \<br/>
- This two-line bullet
  won't break
- This two-line bullet  
  will break

Here is the code:

```
* This two-line bullet
won't break


* This two-line bullet
will break
```

## Ignore Markup

Add \\ before the markdown character.<br/>

## Bullet Point

Add - at the start of the line

## Inline Formatting

| Style           | Syntax              | Example                                    | Output                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Bold            | \*\* \*\* or \_\_   | \*\*This is bold text\*\*                  | **This is bold text**                  |
| Italic          | \* \* or \_ \_      | \*This text is italicized\*                | _This text is italicized_              |
| Strikethrough   | \~~ ~~              | \~~This was mistaken text~~                | ~~This was mistaken text~~             |
| Bold and italic | \*\* \*\* and \_ \_ | \*\*This text is _extremely_ important\*\* | **This text is _extremely_ important** |

The following is a list of optional inline markups supported:

| Style               | Markup          | Result if enabled    |
| ------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Intra-word emphasis | So A\*maz\*ing  | So A<em>maz</em>ing  |
| Strikethrough       | \~~Much wow\~~  | <del>Much wow</del>  |
| Underline [^under]  | \_So doge\_     | <u>So doge</u>       |
| Quote [^quote]      | \"Such editor\" | <q>Such editor</q>   |
| Highlight           | \==So good\==   | <mark>So good</mark> |
| Superscript         | hoge\^(fuga)    | hoge<sup>fuga</sup>  |

## Quoting Text

You can Quote a line by adding "> " at the start of line.<br/>
Eg : \> Hi, Everyone<br/>

> Hi, Everyone

## Tables

Tables can be created easily.

- There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
- The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily.
- You can also use inline Markdown.
- Colons can be used to align columns. (Center :----:, Left :----, Right ----:)

Example :<br/>
Markdown | Less | Pretty<br/>
--- | --- | ---<br/>
_Still_ | `renders` | **nicely**<br/>
1 | 2 | 3

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

## Strong and Emphasize

**Strong**: `**Strong**` or `__Strong__` (Command-B)

_Emphasize_: `*Emphasize*` or `_Emphasize_`[^emphasize] (Command-I)

### Links and Email

Just put angle brackets around an email and it becomes clickable: [roshithbalendran@gmail.com](roshithbalendran@gmail.com)
`roshithbalendran@gmail.com`

### Reference style

Sometimes it looks too messy to include big long urls inline, or you want to keep all your urls together.

Make [a link][arbitrary_id] `[a link][arbitrary_id]` then on it's own line anywhere else in the file:  
`[arbitrary_id]: https://www.github.com "Title"`

If the link text itself would make a good id, you can link [like this][] `[like this][]`, then on it's own line anywhere else in the file:  
`[like this]: https://www.github.com`

[arbitrary_id]: https://www.github.com 'Title'
[like this]: https://www.github.com

### Images

#### Inline

`![Alt Image Text](path/or/url/to.jpg "Optional Title")`

#### Reference style

`![Alt Image Text][image-id]`  
on it's own line elsewhere:  
`[image-id]: path/or/url/to.jpg "Optional Title"`

### Lists

- Lists must be preceded by a blank line (or block element)
- Unordered lists start each item with a `*`

* `-` works too
  - Indent a level to make a nested list
    1. Ordered lists are supported.
    2. Start each item (number-period-space) like `1. `
    3. It doesn't matter what number you use, I will render them sequentially
    4. So you might want to start each line with `1.` and let me sort it out

Here is the code:

```
* Lists must be preceded by a blank line (or block element)
* Unordered lists start each item with a `*`
- `-` works too
	* Indent a level to make a nested list
		1. Ordered lists are supported.
		2. Start each item (number-period-space) like `1. `
		42. It doesn't matter what number you use, I will render them sequentially
		1. So you might want to start each line with `1.` and let me sort it out
```

### Block Quote

> Angle brackets `>` are used for block quotes.  
> Technically not every line needs to start with a `>` as long as
> there are no empty lines between paragraphs.  
> Looks kinda ugly though.
>
> > Block quotes can be nested.
> >
> > > Multiple Levels
>
> Most markdown syntaxes work inside block quotes.
>
> - Lists
> - [Links][arbitrary_id]
> - Etc.

Here is the code:

```
> Angle brackets `>` are used for block quotes.
Technically not every line needs to start with a `>` as long as
there are no empty lines between paragraphs.
> Looks kinda ugly though.
> > Block quotes can be nested.
> > > Multiple Levels
>
> Most markdown syntaxes work inside block quotes.
>
> * Lists
> * [Links][arbitrary_id]
> * Etc.
```

### Inline Code

`Inline code` is indicated by surrounding it with backticks:  
`` `Inline code` ``

If your ``code has `backticks` `` that need to be displayed, you can use double backticks:  
``` ``Code with `backticks` `` ``` (mind the spaces preceding the final set of backticks)

### Block Code

If you indent at least four spaces or one tab, I'll display a code block.

    print('This is a code block')
    print('The block must be preceded by a blank line')
    print('Then indent at least 4 spaces or 1 tab')
    	print('Nesting does nothing. Your code is displayed Literally')

I also know how to do something called [Fenced Code Blocks](#fenced-code-block) which I will tell you about later.

### Horizontal Rules

If you type three asterisks `***` or three dashes `---` on a line, I'll display a horizontal rule:

---

## Fenced Code Block

This is a fenced code block:

```
print('Hello world!')
```

You can also use waves (`~`) instead of back ticks (`` ` ``):

```
print('Hello world!')
```

### Formatting Code

If you want to format the code snippets in a specific Programming Language, simply add the name of the language after the back ticks.

````
\```swift
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }
\```
````

```swift
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }
```

```tsx
export default function App() {
  const [isDark, setIsDark] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsDark(new Date().getHours() > 12);
  }, []);

  return <h1>{isDark ? 'Dark Mode' : 'Light Mode'}</h1>;
}
```
